            <title>Glad tidings of the everlasting Gospel, and doctrine of eternal life With many things profitable for edification to them that fear God; but chiefly exhortations to all that thirst after the waters of life, to prepare and make ready to meet the Lord Jesus Christ, and wait for his coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, according to his word. Let no one despise the day of small things, for the Lord hath hid from the wise and prudent, and revealed to babes and sucklings; he hath chosen the base and contemptible things of the world to confound the things that are high and mighty, and calleth those things which are not, as though they were. Ye saints of the most high God, lift up your heads, for the time of your redemption is nigh, even come, for the signe of the Son of man hath already appeared in the clouds of heaven, which is an infallible token of Sions deliverance. Published and declared (in love to them that mourn in Sion) by an unworthy servant of Jesus Christ, to whom it is revealed to be the least of all saints, John Erlam.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE FAITHFULL READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any Large Books have been written, (since the coming forth of the Gospel) which are full of Errour, Heresie, and Blasphemy, proceeding from wicked and ungodly men: whose minds have been corrupted, by the spirit of error: And though they have been Wise and Learned according to the flesh, yet unlearned in the way of truth; so have wrested and perverted the Scriptures to their own destruction; being ungodly men, of old ordained unto Condemnation. Now this is my desire that all such books were burned and destroyed; But this understand also, that many Faithfull Saints have written for the defence of the Gospel; and many have contended valiantly for the Faith, to the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof with their own blood: who doubtless have received a great reward. Now this is my Councel unto thee Faithful Reader, that thou wouldst not much regard any Books that are written since the Apostles times, but
<pb facs="tcp:34799:4"/> give thy self wholly to the Faith of Jesus Christ, and to the Reading of the holy Scriptures, (which are able to make thee wise unto Salvation though Faith which is in Christ,) and to continual prayer, and to an holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation in Righteousness and Love, and Charity out of a good heart, which is the end of the Commandment; For this understand, that there hath been such dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Church, that the most Faithful have been subject to many errours for want of knowledge; which is nothing but that which was spoken of by the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets should come to pass, the Sun (or glory of the Gospel) should be darkned, and the powers of Heaven shaken: for the Lord would not shake the earth onely, but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven also. Nevertheless, the faithful receive a Kingdom which cannot be shaken; but it hath pleased the Lord to purge Sion with Judgement, and to choose his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the furnace of Affliction, and purifie the sons of <hi>Levi</hi> (or Children of the Everlasting Priesthood) as gold is purified. — and this understand that I find no other Books like unto the Scriptures, therefore have I gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven my self unto the Scriptures onely, in which there is matter enough for any that desires Salvation. And this understand also, that there is no other Book can lead thee to the knowledge of them, it is onely the gift of God; therefore this I could wish, that most books written since the Apostles were burned, with Philosophers Fables and books of Curious Arts. Now these I could best allow: Church Histories, as the Books of Martyrs, and such like, which do give witness to the fulfilling of the Scriptures; But as for books of Controversie and vain disputations, which are without number for multitude, I could wish also were without being; for they onely tend to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version: but this I know that the Lord in his time will
<pb facs="tcp:34799:4"/> remove all things that offend, and all shall perish toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Till then vain is the help of man, for he alone must build the City, and send forth the refreshing river; to which agrees the words of the wise man, in the Song which is <hi>Solomons:</hi> I charge you O Daughters of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> that ye stir not up, nor awake my Love until he please. Nevertheless, let us not rest until the Lord come suddenly unto his Temple, to build up his own City; then shall Heaven and Earth pass away, and their place be found no more.</p>
                  <p>Now as for this little Book which I have written, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire thee to consider it well; if thou find it according to the holy Scriptures, then mayest thou believe that I am a fellow heir with thee of the Kingdom; if not, believe neither it, nor me, (let all things be tried by the holy Scriptures) yet this I know perfectly, that I have found favour in the sight of God, and am made partaker of the like precious Faith the Apostles were. Nevertheless, if thou find it not sweetly agreeing with the truth in Scripture, regard it no more then the books I have councelled thee against; for what am I better then they who have obtained the Crown, and gotten the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory before me: but this I know, that I am armed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to fight the good fight (praised be my Captain and onely Master) to win the Crown reserved in Heaven for all Saints.</p>
                  <p>For though they were subject to much errour and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faults, yet have they overcome by the blood of the everlasting Covenant; having washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, and so are without fault before God, and serve him night and day in his Temple. Even so am I subject to many Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but I have boldness through the blood of Jesus
<pb facs="tcp:34799:5"/> Christ, which cleanseth me from all sin, not that I am without sin, for if I say so, I am a liar, and go about to make God a liar, who hath sent Jesus Christ to set me and all the Elect free from sin; therefore have I hope also towards God, to inherite with them who have gotten the victory before me, by the same way, even Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Friend, this thou mayest understand, that I could have filled the Margent with Scripture proofs which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are written on the leaf, or agree thereto, but this charge I have committed to thee, if thou doubt any thing, search thy self in the Scriptures, yet I have added some few which I think necessary; I seek not for praise of men, neither vain glory, God who knoweth my heart is witness: I could wish that the Scriptures were as in old time without verse or Chapter, for as they are, wresters, perverters and vain disputers, have the more advantage, though they are not the less profitable to me: so desiring the Father of Spirits to make known to thee the riches of his Love, in the everlasting Gospel of his Son, and the Testimony of Jesus Christ, which is the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.</p>

                  <p>Now the testimony of Jesus Christ is wonderfully declared in the Scriptures of Truth, both in the Law and in the Prophets; But in the New Testament written by his faithfull Apostles very plain; so that all who believe the Scriptures, cannot deny Jesus to be the Christ, the Son of God, for all the Scriptures do give witnesse to him: And my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is to declare something of the testimony of Jesus in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

Now this <hi>Moses</hi> whom they despised, saying, <hi>Who made thee a Prince and a Judge?</hi> The same did the Lord raise to be a Captain, and a deliverer, by the hand of the Angell that spoke to him in the bush, and wrought great and mighty wonders in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in the Red Sea, in making his power known on <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and on all his mighty Host, and also in preserving <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wildernesse, giving them Angels food for the space of forty years,

                  <p>Now <hi>Moses</hi> that great Prophet of the Lord, to whom he was pleased to speak mouth to mouth (but he would make himselfe known to other Prophets in dreams or in visions) This holy man of God prophesied to <hi>Israel, That the Lord their God would raise up a Prophet of their brethren like unto him, and him should they heare in all things: And it should come to passe, that whosoever would not heare him should be out off from amongst his brethren and people.</hi> This spoke he of Jesus that great Prophet, who in his time was revealed to <hi>Israel,</hi> as it was written of him in all the Prophets, he was of the feed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the flesh, reckoned by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Son of God proved by mighty signes and wonders which he did; when <hi>John</hi> before had preached the baptisme of repentence and amendment of life, that they might receive remission of sinnes in the Name of Jesus Christ who came after him, but was preferred before him, for he was before him, whose shooe-latchet he confessed he was unworthy to unloose. <hi>John</hi> was he of whom it was spoken; <hi>The voyce of one crying in the wildernesse, saying, prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths streight.</hi> This was that <hi>Elias</hi> the spirit of prophesie spoke of should come before the great day of the Lord, <hi>To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers. John</hi> confessed, and also taught, that Jesus was the Son of God, he had witnesse from him that sent him to baptize with water; for saith he, the same on whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him, is he that shall baptize with the Holy Ghost; And I saw, and bear record saith <hi>John,</hi> that this is the Son of God.

And suddenly there was with the Angell a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and good will towards men. And when the Shepherds came to Bethlehem,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34799:7"/> they found all things according to the vision, &amp; rejoyced with exceeding great joy.</hi> His mighty works did bear record of him; he turned water into wine, he healed all manner of diseases; he caused the blind to see, the dumb to speak, the deaf to hear, the same to go: He commanded the evill spirits, and they obeyed; he cast them our by his Word.

                  <p>Again, he was tempted in the Wildernesse forty dayes without meat, being amongst the wilde beasts, the Devill having all advantage against him, having power given him to shew him all the kingdomes of the World in a moment, willed him to fall down and worship him, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him the glory and riches of them; but the Lord reproved him with the word of his mouth: And when the Devill set him on a pinacle of the Temple, he willed him to cast himselfe down, for it was written, <hi>He shall give his Angels charge over thee to keepe thee in all thy wayes, they shall beare thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.</hi> Now when the Lord had overcome him with the power of his Word, for it was not possible that the Devill could prevail against him, Then the Devill left him, and an Angell ministred unto him; and for this cause was he tempted, that he might succour them who are tempted, for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was compassed about with infirmities, and was in all points like unto us, sin onely excepted. When he came into the world, he tooke not on him the nature of Angels, but the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he was born of a Virgin, and nourished as another man: Forasmuch as children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himselfe took part of flesh and blood, that in all things he might be like unto his brethren; wherefore he saith, <hi>I will declare thy Name amongst my brethren.</hi> Again, <hi>Behold I and the chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and the Lord commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to make a brazen Serpent, and lift it up to the Congregation; <hi>And it came to passe, when any man was stung of the fiery Serpents, when he looked up to the brazen Serpent he was healed.</hi> Which brazen Serpent was a figure of Christ, for so was Christ lift up from the earth, and as many as believe in him are healed of all their sins; For this is the same Gospell the Apostle preached, <hi>That Jesus Christ dyed for the sins of the world,</hi> and as many as believe in him should have their sins remitted and freely forgiven, and not onely so, but life everlasting; That as Christ rose from the dead the third day, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scriptures, so should they who believe in him be raised up in the life immortal, by the power of God who raised up Jesus from the dead, and exalted him at his right hand, and given a name above every name, <hi>That at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, and every tongue confesse Jesus to be the Lord. For as I live saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and all tongues shall confesse to God.</hi> Now this is the sum of all, that we stedfastly believe in God that made heaven and earth, the sea and all things therein, and in Jesus Christ his onely Sonne, and our Lord and Saviour, that he by his death hath purchased for us ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life. Through the free love of the Father in pleasing himselfe in the death of his Son; for saith he, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne in whom I am well pleased.</hi> This is the testimony of the Father, that he was well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as it is written in the Prophets, he will quiet himselfe in his love. Therefore let us now believe the glad tydings of the Gospel without wavering; for verily the truth of the Gospel is glad tydings. Is it not good tydings to believe that all our sins are forgiven us? and all our i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities are blotted out? This is the blessednesse <hi>David</hi> spoke of, when he said, <hi>Blessed are they whose sinnes are forgiven, and iniquities blotted out.</hi> Again, <hi>Blessed are they to whom the Lord will impute no sin. For this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord, I will put my Lawes i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Sinnes freely forgiven, and Iniquities never more to be remembred, and not onely so, but life for ever, with the Father and with the Son, in the immortal glory, even in the Kingdome of heaven, which is prepared for all that believe in his Son Jesus Christ, for he hath promised that everlasting inheritance, that cannot lie. <hi>Feare yee not my little Flocke,</hi> saith the Lord Jesus, <hi>it is my Fathers pleasure to give you the Kingdome.</hi> Oh! excellent tidings is come with Jesus Christ, forgivenesse of sins here in this world,

And veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we be the children of God, he will be carefull for us at all times; And if we suffer for his Name sake that calleth us, or we have peace in the world, all things will work together for good to them that love the Lord; for this understand, that nothing is without the Father, <hi>Therefore the very hairs of our head are numbred.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now concerning how we ought to walk and please God: <hi>John's</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration as I said before, was to repentance and amendment of life, that men should turne from all their sins: For, <hi>the axe is laid to the root of the trees, and every tree that brings not forth good fruit, is hewen down and cast into the fire.</hi> For every man that repenteth not, and turneth not from the evill of his way at the preaching of the Gospell, is like unto the Tree that is hewen down, and cast into the fire: For the Lord <hi>hath the fancie in his hand, and will thorowly purge his floore, and will gather his wheat into his Garner, but will burne the Chaffe with unquenchable fire. For whosoever cometh to me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>&amp; heareth my sayings, &amp; doth them, I will shew you to whom he is like; he is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a Rock, and when the flood arose, the storme heat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it, for it was founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Rock. But he that heareth, and doth not, is like a man that without a foundation bui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore this I say, that such as believe the Gospell, must live in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Gospell, and walke in the Commandements of Christ; And this is the commandement of the Gospell, <hi>That we love one another. Do to all men as we would they should do unto us.</hi> And not onely so, but <hi>love our enemies, yea such as hate us, pray for them that despightfully use us.</hi> And also flee all manner of sinne, as covetousnesse, drunkennesse, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, envy, pride, sloth, gluttony, back-biting, evill speaking, lying. Let us endeavour at all times to speak the truth, and walke as in the day-time in all holy conversation, endeavouring to excell in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good work, for this is a manifest signe that we are ordained unto eternall life, if we walke in good works; for so it is ordained, that they that believe unto eternall life, should walke in good works. Not that we are justified by our good works, but freely by his grace, through faith in his name; but such as say they have faith, though they want works, can their faith save them? I say faith without workes is dead, like a body without a spirit: It is like, as though a man should say to one that is naked, cold, and hungry, be thou cloathed, warmed, and filled, Yet giveth him neither food nor raiment, nor suffereth him to come at his fire, but biddeth him depart in peace, but mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streth not to him the things he stands in need of, even so is faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works, of no value. For as we are justified by his free grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our own righteousnesse and good works, so ought we to bring forth the fruits of righteousnesse in all holinesse, not onely by commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but in love; For is the Father h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th freely loved us, in putting away our sins by the blood of his Son, so let our love appeare to our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34799:8"/> Father in doing his Will through unfained love, for we are not under the Law, but under grace, and where there is no law, there is no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression. Wherefore we have peace with God the Father, through the death of his Son, who hath reconciled us unto God by his own blood, so that he is made of God unto us wisdom, righteousnesse, sanctification, and redemption; for it hath pleased the Father, that in him should all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse dwell: And this I say, of our good works, that we are not in the least justified by them; for when we have done all that we can, it is but our duty, and we ought to confesse our selves unprofitable servants. Notwithstanding good works are profitable unto salvation, for in this do we appear to be the Children of God, if we do his Commandements: For, <hi>the Lord will judge the world in righteousnesse, and the people with equity. And every man shall receive according to his deeds, whether they be good or evill. For the Lord will bring every secret thing to judgement, whether good or evill: for we shall all stand at the Judgement-seat of Christ, and shall receive accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our workes done in the body, for there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust, and every one must give an account unto God.</hi> Therefore this I believe, that such as believe in Jesus Christ, &amp; hope in God (who raised him up in glory) for eternall life, and yeeld obedience to the Commandements of God, do surely inherit the Crown of glory laid up for them in heaven; but such as heare the Gospell, and regard it not, but walke after the flesh, in swearing, lying, pride, covetousness, which is idolatry, fornication, envy, and the like, are vessels fitted for destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for such shall not inherit the Kingdome of God, and for these things sake cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Therefore they that are elect of God, are such as keep the miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Faith in a good conscience, and by righteousnesse do seek for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and immortality; but they who are ordained of old unto condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, do walke after the flesh, and serve it in the lust thereof, being filled with all manner of evill, envy, strife, maliciousnesse, fornication, murder, theft, drunkennesse, pride, covetousnesse, sorcery, witchcraft, and the like, for which things sake the wrath of God breaks upon them. And though the Lord beare long with the ungodly, yet hee will bring them to judgement, and their sinnes shall be set in order before them, and they shall utterly perish branch and root, and their generation be found no more, when the smoak of their torment shall ascend up for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have written (according to my weake understanding) of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ and the Gospel of salvation by him (for he is the onely way of life) and of the witnesse he hath recorded in the holy Scriptures, that he indeed was the Christ, the onely Saviour of all men that are called according to the purpose of the Father: For all the Scriptures give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent witnesse to him, both the Law and the Prophets, but especially his faithfull Apostles of his birth, of his life, of his wayes, of his mighty works, and great Miracles, of his Doctrine, of his Commandements, of his promise, He gave witness to them by the spirit of prophesie, that he was the Son of God, in telling them many things before, which they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34799:9"/> evidently saw to be true, and fulfilled before their eyes. He told them before of his sufferings, and the manner also, and of his rising again from the dead the third day.

They gave full witnesse of his Resurrection and Truth of the Gospell; they preached in his Name, they spake the Tongues, they healed the Lame, they cast our Devils, they raised the dead, and healed all manner of diseases by the power of the spirit through faith in his Name, that his words might be fulfilled.</p>

                  <p>Now concerning the outward Ordinances of Christ in his Church, I understand there be two. Baptisme and his Supper, practiced by hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and are to be till his coming, and the end of the world; <hi>For as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34799:9"/> many as believed were baptized in the Name of Jesus for remission of sins:</hi> But now there is a controversie, and hath been long amongst brethren, for I dare account them no other, and my brethren also about <hi>Baptisme,</hi> who ought to be baptized: And whether children of Believers have right to that Ordinance or no, to the which by the grace of God I will shew my judgement; not as one that pretends to be wise in the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God, but rather desire to be faithfull, according to the measure of Faith the Lord hath dealt to me, desiring unfeignedly from my heart, that the God of Heaven would put to an end, not this Controversie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but all other amongst all brethren that believe the holy Scriptures, and professe the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and walke in obedience to his Commandements, according to the measure of faith, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of knowledge; but such as profess the Lord Jesus with their words, but deny him in their works, I judge them not, but God himselfe, who knoweth the secrets of all hearts, shall judge them; for judgement is in the house of God. <hi>And if the Righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinners appear?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now brethren, this I say of Baptisme (I beseech you beare with my plainnesse) that such as believe in Jesus Christ that he is the Sonne of God, and in believing do turn from their wickednesse, and become obedient to the <hi>Gospell,</hi> should be baptized in his Name, in whom they believe for remission of all their sins: This was practiced by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and you both believe and agree to it; but now whether Children of Believers, while they are children, ought to be baptized or no, till they have understanding to give an account of their faith? I am fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Children of believing Parents ought to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>First, That children belong to the Kindome of God, the Lord Jesus Christ plainly taught, when he tooke little children in his armes, and blessed them: When the Disciples saw it, they were offended, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked him; but he plainly reproved their ignorance, saying, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdome of God</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Verily whosoever shall not receive the kingdome of God as a little Childe, shall in no wise enter therein,</hi> How harmlesse and innocent are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children? (O that I were as a little Childe!) Children praised him in the Temple, and so was fulfilled that which was written, <hi>Out of the mouth of babes thou hast perfected praise. Paul,</hi> that faithfull and able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Christ, believed and also taught, that the children of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Father, though the Mother believed not, were clean: and the children of a believing Mother, though the Father believed not, were clean, because the unbelieving Husband is sanctified by the believing Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is sanctified by the believing husband, else were their children unclean, but now are they holy. Now if such children be clean, how much rather shall not they be counted clean and holy that are borne of believing Parents? Therefore my beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren consider well, if children belong to the Kingdome, as he hath said, <hi>Of such is the Kingdome of God:</hi> And he hath taught us also, that if
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34799:10"/> we <hi>receive not the kingdome as a little Childe, we shall in no wife enter therein;</hi> for it is easie with him to open the mouth of Babes to shew forth his praise. Therefore this I say, If children of believers belong to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, how much more then to the Church? And if both to the Kingdome and to the Church, may I not say with <hi>Peter, who can forbid water that these may not be baptized?</hi> But it may be you will answer, that there is neither command nor example in the Scripture, for Children to be baptized: To which I say, I am perswaded that there is example from the Apostles that baptized whole Families, in which it is like there were Children; but I dare not say there was, yet I believe there was. So I suppose you dare not say there was not, neither am I perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to believe there was not; but if there was, as very likely, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and command is sore: But who art thou that believest in the Lord Jesus Christ for remission of sins, and hopes in God the Father for eternall life which he hath promised, that cannot lye to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and obey the Gospel? Now if thou and thy Wife also have this hope towards God, what hopest thou of thine own Children, that they are fellow-heirs with thee of the Kingdom? and if thou judgest so of thine own children, allow the same to thy brethren, seeing children belong to the kingdome, <hi>For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all that are afarre off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.</hi> Therefore I think it good, brethren, that are become as <hi>little Children,</hi> innocent as Doves, wise as Serpents, that we may be fit for the Kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the Supper of the Lord, this was given in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christs death till he come: <hi>For the Lord Jesus the same night he was betrayed, tooke bread, and when he had given thanks he brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given unto you, this do in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi> And likewise he took the Cup after Supper, saying, <hi>This Cup is the new Testament in my blood which is shed for you: And as often as they did eat that bread, and drink that cup, they did shew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> For as bread is meat indeed, and wine is drink indeed, much more is the body of Christ meat indeed, and blood drink indeed, and far excelleth temporal food: <hi>For he that eateth bread shall hunger again, and he that drinketh wine shall thirst again; but he that eates the flesh of the Son of man, shall never hunger, and he that drinks his blood shall never thirst, but in him shall spring up a well unto life everlasting:</hi> and this is onely by saith in him.</p>
                  <p>Now this I say, as our bodies are strengthened and fed with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bread and drinke, so certainly are we quickned unto the immortal life, through the body of Christ which is broken for us, and his blood which is shed for us, even the blood of the New Covenant. Therefore it doth evidently appear, that we have life by him alone. Now this I suppose meet, when the Saints are met together at convenient times, that they take bread with thankfulnesse, and eate thereof in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christs body that was sacrificed for their sins; and also drinke of the Cup in remembrance of his blood, even the blood of the Lamb by which we are cleansed: For as in the Law almost all things were clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by blood, and without blood there was no remission: Even so are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34799:10"/> all that believe the Gospel with obedience, cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ, according as the Apostle saith, <hi>with one gift he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</hi> Now if we do thus eat and thus drinke in remembrance of Christ, we doe shew forth his death till he come: And blessed are they that eate and drink worthily, for they that do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise are condemned, because they through faith discern not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore let us be stedfast in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith, that we be not condemned in the World with the wicked and unfaithful generation; For such as once are called to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the way of truth, so as to escape the pollutions of the World, through the knowledge of the Lord, and yet turn again after the lusts of wickednesse, the latter end of such is worse then their beginning.</p>
                  <p>Neverthelesse the foundation of God stands sure, having the seale, the Lord knows who are his from the beginning, even the Lord, with whom nothing is impossible, fore-savv from the beginning his elect: <hi>And whom he fore-saw he predestinated, to be conformable to the image of his Sonne, that he might be the first borne amongst many brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And also <hi>whom he predestinated, he called, and whom he called, them he justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whom he justified, them he glorified.</hi> O excellent Gospel! What shall we say to these things? <hi>If God be for us, who shall be against us?</hi> If God who changeth not, have sealed us unto eternall glory, who can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us thereof? If God who cannot lye, have promised, what power can alter his pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pose? for he in whom we believe, hath all power in heaven and in earth, and under the earth, by whom all things were created both in heaven and in earth, the Sea and all things therein: So that <hi>the things which are seene, are not made of the things that do appear,</hi> but by the Word of God: O unspeakable power of the Almighty God! who can finde out all his workes? <hi>His judgements are deep, and his wayes past finding out.</hi> For who hath been his Councellor at any time, or who hath given unto him that he may be rewarded? For by him, and from him are all things.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then we have such a Father dwelling in Heaven, let us not fear, but go on diligently in the way of the Lord, looking for the crown of glory which we shall receive, for we are the Children of God through the faith of Christ. If children, then heirs with him of the Kingdome, fellow-heirs, joynt-heirs with the Son: And as Jesus our eldest brother was raised up by the glory of the Father, so shall we by the same Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power be raised up, and be made partakers of the same glory with the Father and with the Son. And this is a great and exceeding promise, that we shall be made partakers of the Divine nature. Therefore my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved brethren, how ever you are called, or under what name soever you be, if you hope to be made partakers of the glory of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, then strive to walke as he did for an example, and learn of him to be meek in spirit, and lowly in heart; for in his humility he was exal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed▪ Therefore let us strive to be humble, that with him we may be exalted; <hi>For he that humbleth himselfe shall be exalted, but he that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth himselfe shall be abased. The Lord gives grace to the humble, but the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34799:11"/> proud he beholds afar off.</hi> Therefore let every one esteem himselfe no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his brother, and vvalke in love one tovvards another, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of one Father, and fellovv heirs of the same inheritance. If vvee had love one towards another, vve should love one another, and not speak evill one of another; for love covereth a multitude of faults. Love is precious and excellent, it is even the bond of perfection, it is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Lavv; For the end of the Commandement is charity, out of a pure heart. Love is the chief Commandement of the Gospel, saith the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>In this shall it be known that yee are my Disciples, if ye love one another. If yee keepe my Commandements, yee shall abide in my love</hi> (saith he) and his Commandement was, <hi>that we should love one another.</hi> The sum of the Gospel doth stand in these thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, <hi>Faith, Hope, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> And thus I believe, through the rich mercy of God which appeared to me, when I was as dead, because I had drunken deeply of the waters that were made bitter, by that star that is called <hi>Worm-wood;</hi> but praised be the name of my God, who hath healed mee with the Water of the River coming from his Temple. I believe that Jesus Christ hath offered up himselfe unto the Father an acceptable sacrifice for the sinnes of the whole World, <hi>That as many as believe in him should not perish, but have life everlasting:</hi> And because he hath given me to believe, I have hope also of etereal life. To speak as plainly as I can, this I say, I believe that all my sins are forgiven by the death of his Son Jesus Christ, and free mercy of God: Therefore I feare not the Wrath to come, as though the Lord had sent his Angel unto me, saying, <hi>All thy sinnes are forgiven thee,</hi> I <hi>will have mercy on thee, thou shalt live for ever.</hi> Even so do I believe the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which was not declared by Angels, but by his owne Son, whom he hath appointed heire of all things, who by inheritance hath obtained a more excellent Name then they: For unto which of the Angels said he at any time, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have</hi> I <hi>begotten thee?</hi> Again, I <hi>will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Sonne:</hi> So that the Angels must vvorship him who are his Ministring spirits, sent forth into the World for their sakes who are heirs of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Now in him I believe for remission of sins, to vvhom the Angels and heavenly povvers are subject, vvho is exalted at the right hand of God for ever. This is my saith to believe in Jesus Christ for the forgivenesse of all my sins: And this is my hope in God for eternal life, and this is my charity to have love tovvards God and man, and to have a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence void of offence towards both. Neverthelesse I finde my flesh weak and full of infirmities, lusting against the Spirit, and much contrary, so that I cannot do the things that I would; <hi>but when I would do good, evill is present with me; for my spirit is willing, but my flesh is weake:</hi> and I see many temptations follow our nature, For I my selfe have had great tryal in Temptation almost every way, but praised be my God, even the God of Heaven, who hath delivered me out of all Temptations, and still doth deliver me, and I hope will do to the end, that I may for ever rejoyce with the Saints in Light; for he is faithful, and well able, who will not suffer his to be tempted above what they are able, but in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34799:11"/> the Temptation will make way whereby they shall escape. Now this is a most excellent thing, <hi>that we are not under the Law, but under grace:</hi> That we are not justified by the workes of the Law, but freely by his grace: Therefore we need not feare Transgression, because we are not under the Law, but dead to the Law by the body of Christ. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our Justification in the sight of God without fault, because <hi>he is the end of the Law for righteousnesse sake to every one that believes.</hi> Therefore let us not feare the weaknesse of our nature, and infirmities of our flesh, because God will not impute our trespasses to us; For this is the word of Reconciliation, <hi>that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi> in not imputing their trespasses to them.</p>
                  <p>Now this I say and believe of <hi>them that are elect according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God,</hi> that walk after the spirit, and not after the flesh, as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them; As they are not justified by their own righteousness and good works, but by the righteousnesse of Christ, so are they not condemned by their manifold infirmities and trespasses, because they are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> imputed to them. Therefore being thus reconciled unto God by the Gospel of his Son, let us not feare, but war valiantly to obtain the immortal Crown. Although I see with my flesh I serve the Law of sin, yet with the spirit I serve the Law of God; for the spirit seeks after the things that are spiritual, but the flesh after the things that are fleshly, and these two are contrary. The one seeks to fulfil the Law of God, the other seeks to transgresse. Now <hi>if we walke after the spirit wee shall live, but if we walke after the flesh we shall dye:</hi> Therefore let us by the spirit mortifie the deeds of the body; for if we walke after the spirit, we shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh: <hi>Resist the Devill, and he will flee.</hi> Let us not think it strange to be tempted, for the tryall of our faith is much more precious then gold; and happy are they that can endure tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for they shall inherit the promise.</p>
                  <p>Now I do exhort my brethren, <hi>that we do adde unto our faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godlinesse, and to godlinesse brotherly kindnesse, and to brotherly kindnesse charity;</hi> For if these things be in us, and abound, they will make us that we shall never be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord; but an entrance shall be ministred unto us of the everlasting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Therefore let us cast off every thing that may hinder us in the way of the Lord, and take unto our selves the whole armour of God, the sword of the Spirit, the shield of faith, and for a helmet the hope of savation, having our loyns girt with the girdle of love, and our feet shod with the preparation of the everlasting Gospel of peace. Being thus armed, let us fight valiantly against all our enemies, the world, the flesh, and the Devil, yea all the powers of darknesse cannot prevail against us, While we keep in the Armour of God, and pray continually to him that is able to help us, but use not vaine repetition in prayer, let your words be few, and faith strong; for this understand that the Lord knows what we stand in need of before we aske of him, better then we our selves; therefore let us aske in faith without wavering, that we may receive
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34799:12"/> our petitions, let us pray one for another, and for the whole Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Now my beloved brethren, I exhort against two things, first in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king long prayers, and using many words; second, in praying for remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins: the first, the Lord forbids vain repetition in prayer, for saith he, <hi>they think to bee heard for their much babbling:</hi> He used few words in prayer, and so did the Apostles; the second, if thou believe in Christ that all thy sins are remitted, why prayest thou to God for remission of them? I understand it to be a fruit of doubting and not of faith. Now this I think meet when thou prayest to God, to use but few words, and pray to him as though he stood by thee as a man, and also believe that he knows every thought and intent of thy heart, then thou mayest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thy self according as thou findest thy self, and ask of him the things thou stands in need of, speak plainly unto him, regard not set forms to have praise of men, (as hypocrites do who have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) for I am perswaded, that it is far better to pray ten words with faith and zeal; then ten thousand words in a set form. But thou wilt say, that the Prophets prayed for remission of sins, and Christ taught to pray for remission of sins, when he taught his Disciples to pray, but that I understand to be as much Doctrine as prayer, in which is excellent things to be understood. First, that God which is in heaven is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that we ought to praise and hallow his Name, and that from him we receive our daily bread, for the earth is the Lords, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof. Now understand how he taught us to pray for forgiveness of sins, even upon condition, <hi>forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespasse against us;</hi> for, saith he, if you forgive them that trespasse against you, then will your heavenly Father forgive you your tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes.</p>
                  <p>Now this I say, before Christ died for his people, they did well to cry earn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>stly unto the Lord for the remission of their sins; but since Christ was made an offering for sin, there remains no more sacrifice for sin to them that believe, but only praise, even the calves of our lips, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless this understand, that if we forgive not them that trespass against us, neither shall we be forgiven; therefore as God hath forgiven us through the death of his Son, we ought to forgive one another, and all that trespass against us, else how dare thou pray to be forgiven as thou forgivest, and yet forgivest not, but seekest revenge; herein thou ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest thy own condemnation, in praying for thy destruction; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore consider how thou prayest, let Wisdome be thy Councellor, lest thou become wicked, and thy prayer abominable. This is my counsel to thee, that thou pray often, but beware of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> example, which Christ forbid, but rather obey the excellent counsel of Christ, when thou prayest enter into thy Closet, and pray to thy Heavenly Father in secret, who shall reward thee openly. <note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> And that it is good to pray often, remember the words of Christ; and the Apostle exhorts to pray without ceasing, for such a one is he in whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, even able to help us at all times, and give us any thing we want;

                  <p>Now concerning Church Traditions, the Saints are not bound to daies and times, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were under the Law, which things were but shadows, but the substance of them all was Christ; therefore the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance being come, the shadows are done away, else were we still in bondage unto the Law, but now are we freed and set at liberty by the Body of Christ, that we should not be as servants under the Law, but the children of God, walking in love and righteousness: for if we were bound to observe daies and times, we were still under the Law; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith <hi>Paul,</hi> Let no one judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the New Moons, or of the Sabbath daies, which things were shadows of things to come, but the body is of Christ.

First, he reproves them for their strictness, that they would not allow the Works of necessity on the Sabbath day, with that of <hi>David,</hi> saying, <hi>Have ye not read what</hi> David <hi>did when he was an hungred, and they that were with him, how he entered into the house of God, and did eat Shew-bread, which w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

(And after at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times they were offended at him, for healing on the Sabbath day, but he reproved them) And in that he spoke of the Priest profaning the

                     </gap> are blameless, for our Temple is greater then that outward Temple was, as he himself said, <hi>one greater then the Temple is here;</hi> yet more he teaches, if ye had known what this meaneth, <hi>I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless,</hi> which doth plainly hold forth the end of the Law, the end of Sacrifice, and only Mercy, which is the riches of his Love in the Gospel of his Son; so if they had known this Scripture, <hi>I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice,</hi> they would have known the Gospel, and understood that the Disciples had been guiltless, though they broke the Sabbath, so they would not have condemned them, because the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath day: seeing then that the Sabbath daies are put to an end in him, wherefore then are ye zealous for a Sabbath, and not the seventh day, which was commanded of the Lord to be kept in its time? but another day have ye chosen, which ye have no Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for in all the Scriptures, neither Christ nor his Apostles gave Commandment to keep a Sabbath day; therefore my Brethren consider of this thing, for it is no Commandment of the Lord, but a Tradition of men, contrary to the truth of the Gospel, (as I have shewed before) and came in with other error and idolatry, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>Now this your Sabbath, the first day of the Week, there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment for in all the Scriptures, to be a Sabbath kept holy unto the Lord. You may read of the Saints meeting together the first day of the Week, but what is that to a Sabbath? for I suppose it meet for the Church of God to meet together once a week at the least, to exhort one another in the Mysteries of the Gospel, and I know not but the first day of the week may be as convenient as another, or another as it, though in the Apostles time, the Saints met together on the first day of the week, therefore they knew well, how that they were not to observe the Sabbath, else would they have met together on the 7th day, and have kept the Sabbath. Now Brethren, this I say, if ye regard daies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the first daies, or other daies, regard them to the Lord, for some count one day better then another, but others every day alike: Let every one be fully perswaded in his own heart, and so let him walk: Nevertheless thou hast no Commandment in the Gospel to observe daies or times, but art at liberty in holiness: So if thy liberty be to keep a day holy, keep it holy unto the Lord, but beware of keeping a day to the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof: and let us not judge one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in these things; for what if thou keep a day holy unto the Lord to humble thy self in fasting and prayer, shall I judge thee therein? or if I keep a day holy unto the Lord, who shall judge me therein? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us not judge one another, but rather pray one for another, for he that judgeth another, and oth the same thing, therein he judgeth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34799:13"/> himself, and ye that believe in a Sabbath, will be judging others that break the Sabbath, and yet ye your selves keep it not holy; is not your iudgement against your selves? As for me, I keep it not as a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath commanded of the Lord, but that I may walk without offence, such liberty I have, that I seek to walk before all men without offence, though I see the world full of offences, and all manner of wickedness and not only in the world, but amongst the most faithful Brethren many offences and errors, the Lord hasten to shorten these daies, for I fear the Lord makes a short work upon the earth, and that few enter in at the strait gate that leads unto life everlasting. Now it is far from me to wound the conscience of any that is zealous for the Sabbath, or to lay a stumbling block of offence before them, for this I am perswaded, that many, who have in their times been zealous for the same thing, and also subject to many other errors, are now in heaven, and for ever clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from all pollution: for if <hi>Peter,</hi> that great and excellent Apostle, was to be blamed for error, in not going the right way to the truth of the Gospel, for which thing <hi>Paul</hi> reproved him openly; then no marvel if we who are so weak, be subject to error, therefore it is good and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to teach one another, and reprove in love, that we may be fellow-helpers one of another to the everlasting Kingdome: but such is the times of darkness, almost all orders in the Churches are lost, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and error instead thereof, because the glory of the Gospel hath been, and is very greatly darkned, according to what is spoken in the Scriptures: For in the beginning of the Gospel; in the Apostles times, when the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Again, whosoever sins ye remit, they shall be remitted, and whosoever sins ye retain, they shall be retained.</hi> Therefore vvhen the Churches vvere taught, and had vvith obedience received the vvord of the Gospel of their Salvation, then being the Body of Christ, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one of another, every member had its ovvn place to the edifying of it self in love, grevv compleat together, receiving encrease from the head: so every one as he had received the gift from God. vvas to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister therein, and not to go behind his gift. First, such as were full of Faith and the Holy Ghost the Apostles chose, by laying on of hands and prayer, when the multitude of believers were encreased, their charge grew too great, both of the Ministration of the Gospel, and of the Saints charity, so that there was a neglect of the daily Ministration of the Saints charity, and the Apostles thought it not good to leave the Word of God, and serve Tables, therefore they desired their Brethren to look out seven men of honest report, full of wisdome, and of the Holy Ghost, that they might be set over that business, that they might
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34799:14"/> give themselves continually to the Word of God, and prayer, so they had help from their fellow-brethren to the furtherance of the Gospel; and as the number of Disciples encreased, so did helpers also. Now the office of a Bishop, I understand to be a Minister of Christ for the Church, to whom is committed the charge of the Doctrine of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now these are to be tryed, and if they be found blameless, they may use the office of a Deacon; but this understand, that it is lawful for a Deacon to use the office of a Bishop or Elder, and for an Elder to use the office of a Deacon, for the Apostles, who were Elders, used the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Deacons when they served Tables, and also some of the seven Deacons used the office of Elders, when they preached boldly the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Jesus Christ. Also <hi>Paul</hi> used the office of a Deacon in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Saints charity, so that Deacons and Elders are fellow-helpers in love (rather then distinct Officers) for the persecting of the Saints, and keeping up the way of Righteousness, according to the Gospel.</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:34799:14"/>
                  <p>Now when the Churches were thus established in the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ; having these helps in government, they had power to binde and loose; for if any amongst them were disobedient in not submitting to the righteousnesse of the Gospel, and did rebell against the way of Truth, they were to note such; and if they would not repent with one consent, put them out from amongst them, that they may be ashamed, yet not count them as enemies, but as brethren, in exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that if it be possible they may repent, and be received in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but if they refuse to be reproved, and will not repent of their wickednesse, but go on to destruction, such indeed are delivered unto Sathan, and it had beene good for them if they had never beene born.</p>
                  <p>Christ taught his Disciples of this doctrine of Excommunication, when he spoke after this manner; <hi>If thou see thy brother offend, tell him of his fault between him and thee: If he heare thee, thou hast won thy brother; but if he will not heare thee, take with thee one or two more: And if he will not heare them, tell it to the Church; but if he will not heare the Church, count him as a heathen man: For whatsoever yee loose on earth shall be loosed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and whatsoever yee binde on earth, shall be bound in heaven. Paul</hi> wrote to the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> that they should use this power against that fornicator: That when the Church was met t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gether with the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, that they should deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord, and they were obedient to his Doctrine in putting him out from amongst them; but it pleased the Lord to give him repentance, to mourn and be afflicted for his sinne; Therefore the Apostle exhorts them to have compassion on him, and minister their love unto him, and rather forgive him, then over-charge him with sorrow. <hi>Paul</hi> also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave him in the person of Christ, according to Christs words, <hi>Whosesoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sinnes yee remit, they shall be remitted; and whosesoever sinnes ye retaine, they shall be retained.</hi> Now <hi>Paul</hi> wrote not unto them onely for his sake that did the wrong, nor for his sake that had the wrong, but that his care might appeare to them in the Doctrine of Christ. And he exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Brethren to note them that caused division, and that walked not orderly according to the Gospell, such as were covetous, or drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, or fornicators, or raylers, that they should not keep compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with them, no not so much as to eate; but rather if they repent not, hold them accursed. Now this power of binding and loosing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs rather to the office of an Elder, then a Deacon, though it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not onely to them, but to the Deacons, and every member, even the whole Church; For an Elder or Bishop hath not power by vertue of his office (as wicked Usurpers suppose) but by the vertue of the gift of God in them, whereby they are made more excellent in the knowledge of the mystery of the Gospel, and able to discern between good and evill, in the things that differ, for the Church ought to do all things in wisdome and love, with one heart and mind.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the Church-charity, in the beginning of the Gospel

                  <p>
                     <hi>What advantage would it be to us to win the whole world, and lose our own souls? or what would we give in exchange for our souls? therefore blessed are they that believe the Gospel of eternal life, and are called therein, according to the purpose of the Father, such have cause to rejoyce evermore.</hi> This under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand also, that all sorts of people in the Church, are under the Church Government, which stands in righteousness, without respect of persons, both to Elders, Bishops, Deacons, Brethren, high and low, rich and poor; therefore as the Apostle saith, <hi>Reprove not an Elder without two or three witnesses,</hi> And this I say, (who am the least of all Saints, and a Child in the knowledge of heavenly things, and scarcely worthy to be called a Christian) if they be found guilty, let them be reproved, and judged as the others.

                  <p>Now the cause why women are not allowed to teach in the Church, I am perswaded is this: They are the weaker vessels, and more easie to be deceived and drawn aside into errour; for <hi>Adam</hi> was first created, then <hi>Eve,</hi> but <hi>Adam</hi> was not first deceived; but the Woman being deceived was found in the transgression.

                  <p>Now for men, it was permitted that every one, as they had received the gift, might Minister decently and in order; for when the Church was met together in one place, such as were filled with the knowledge of the mystery of Truth, did Minister in teaching one another, <hi>that all might learne and be edified.</hi> And thus was their order; when one was speaking, and another had revelation, till the first held his peace, the second spoke not, and so the other kept the same course, whether they had Psalmes, or Doctrine, or Revelation; And if any spake strange Tongues, it must be by Interpreters: So were all things done decently and in order, to the Churches comfort and profit, and to the edifying of it selfe in love, through the rich grace of God in Christ Jesus, the chief Captain and head of his Church.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching their maintenance who were Ministers of the Word and Doctrine, giving themselves wholly up to that holy Calling, it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that the Ministers of the Gospel should live of the Gospel; for if

                  <p>Now my purpose is to declare according to my vveak understanding, concerning the mystery of the seven Seals.

And no man in heaven nor in earth, nor under the earth was able to open the booke, neither to looke thereon; And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the Book, neither to look thereon. And one of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders said unto me, weep not, behold the Lyon of the Tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seales thereof. And I beheld, and he in the middest of the Throne and of the four Beasts, and in the middest of the Elders there stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hornes, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth,</hi> Rev. 5. (read to the end) Novv thus I understand those things; The Book in the Lords hand written within, and the back side sealed with seven seals, did signifie the mystery of mans salvati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, which was lost by reason of transgression: So death reigned over all, and no man was able to restore himself; but being driven from the presence of God, lay under wrath and condemnation, but the Lord who is rich in mercy, did purpose in himselfe to save some. Now when <hi>John</hi> saw the mystery of mans salvation, sealed up with so many seals, and that no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth was found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to open the Book, neither to look thereon, he had cause to weep, and all men with him, for the way of salvation being sealed up; but one of the Elders declared glad tidings, saying, <hi>Behold the Lyon of the Tribe of Judah, the root of David hath prevailed to open the booke, and loose the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven seales thereof.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> saw Jesus Christ the Lamb of God, who was both able and worthy to open the Book, and loose the seven Seales thereof: And the four Beasts and four and twenty Elders gave honour and praise to him, and many Angels praised him; yea, every creature in heaven and in earth, and under the earth praised him, for to him is committed all power in heaven and in earth, and under the earth.</p>
                  <p>Now when the Lamb opened one of the seven seales of the Book, <hi>John</hi> heard as the voyce of Thunder, one of the four beasts saying, <hi>Come and see: And</hi> I <hi>saw, and beheld</hi> (saith he) <hi>a white horse, and he that sate upon him had a how, and a Crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to overcome;</hi> Which mystery I do understand doth signifie the Son of Mans going forth with the everlasting Covenant of life, riding powerfully in righteousness to bring the elect children to the Kingdom, which is signified by the first beast that was like a Lyon. And when he had opened the second Seale, I heard the second Beast say, <hi>Come and see, and there went out another horse that was red, and power was given to him that sate thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and there was given to him a great sword.</hi> This I believe doth signifie the Wars, and rumours of Wars, which Christ foretold of should come to passe: And his people should be persecuted, and evill spoken of, and some of them suffer death for his Names sake, and they that killed them
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34799:17"/> should thinke they did God good service, their mindes and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings being so darkned through the mystery of idolatry, which is signified by the revealing of this mystery by the second Beast, which was like a Calfe: And when he had opened the third Seal; I heard the third beast say, <hi>Come and see: And I beheld, and loe a blacke horse, and he that sate on him had a paire of ballance in his hand: And I heard a voyce in the middest of the foure beasts say, a measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny, and see thou hurt not the oyle nor the wine.</hi> Which mystery doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gifie, that in the middest of all these plagues there should be plenty of Corne and Oyle; though the black Horse might peradventure signifie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and dearth, yet not of Bread, but of hearing the Word of God, as it is written in the Prophets, For the Lord doth remember his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which he hath made with all flesh, not to destroy the earth any more for mans sake. And when he had opened the fourth Seale, I heard the fourth Beast say, <hi>Come and see: And I looked, and behold a pale horse, and his name that sate thereon was Death, and He I followed with him, and power was given unto him over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword and with hanger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</hi> This mystery doth signifie a great and most fearfull destruction in the earth, that many should dye by the sword in the Nations, by the power of the first Beast which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out of the Sea, or the earthly power of the raging heathen, whose name is Death, and the Grave. And many in the Nations are fallen by his power, and perished in perdition, and fallen in the world without either faith or hope, or any knowledge of God, even like unto the beasts of the earth. And this is signified also by the 4th beast, who was like unto a flying Eagle, wch is high, and of a devouring nature. And when he had opened the 3th Seal, I saw under the Altar the souls of them that were slain for the Word of God, and for the Testimony which they held: and they cryed with a loud voyce, saying, <hi>How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth. And white robes were given to every one of them: And it was said unto them, they should rest yet for a little season, untill their fellow-servants also and their brethren that should be killed, as they were, should be fulfilled.</hi> The mystery of this I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand to be the second Beast that <hi>John</hi> saw rise out of the earth, which had two horns like the Lamb, but spake as a Dragon; which doth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the power of the first beast, and hath made an Image to the first beast, and hath given power thereto, that the Image should speak; and cause as many as will not worship it, should be persecuted and killed. This second Beast is one with the first, and exerciseth the same power; but more deceivable, for he hath horns like the Lamb: he pretends to fight for the Lamb, and shews himselfe as though he stood for the Saints. So under the title of the Lambs, he maketh war against the Lamb; And in pretending friendship to the Saints, he slayes them as wicked men, as many as the Lord permits him, and their blood cries night and day for revenge, and he will revenge his Saints that cries night and day. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse they who have suffered death or persecution for Christs sake, and have been faithfull to the end, have received a full reward of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34799:18"/> life; but what is that to the beast and earthly powers, they shall be revenged according to their works, and receive judgement from the Lord: And this is a great desolation that the Beast and the Dragon should not onely have power to deceive the world, but have power also in the Church to kill, persecute, and make warre with them, their appointed time, even forty and two moneths, while the the holy City is troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot; and this I understand to be the mystery of the fifth Seal, <hi>And I behe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together, and every mountaine and Island were moved out of their places: and the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chiefe Captains, and the mighty men, and every bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and every free-man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountaines, and said to the rocks and the mountaines fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This mystery I understand to be a terrible Vision, and greatly fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; for the earth is mightily shaken by the former judgments and plagues, and still it is shaken more and more: The Sunne being darkned, and the Moon turned into blood, and the Stars fallen from heaven, this is a great desolation spoken by the holy Prophets; the glorious shining of the Gospell is darkned through the smoak of the bottomlesse pit: And many faithfull Saints have been slain by the power of the Beast and false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which were the locusts that ascended out of the smoak of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless pit: And the Sun and the Aire is darkned by reason of the smoak of the bottomlesse pit: And also many Stars are fallen from heaven. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who outwardly have appeared some-what in the time of Tryall and hour of temptation have fallen to the earth, who have seemed like stars, and many Saints also who have been stars indeed, have been cast down to the earth, and troden under foot: But the Lord will never forsake the least of his, but in due time will judge their cause: And though <hi>Sion</hi> be as a Fig-tree that is shaken of a mighty winde, yet the Lord is with her in the middest of all her poverty. And heaven departed as a scroll when when it is rolled together, and every Mountain and Island were moved out of their place, the glory and beauty of the earth hath beene much destroyed by the great plagues of God, and wrath of the Lamb. By the Sword, Plague, and Pestilence in all the Nations, which hath beene powred forth upon the Kings of the Earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty men, and all sorts of people bond and free; For certainly if the Lord set up judgement in his owne house, how shall the raging Nations escape his wrath? Therefore as he hath said <hi>he will judge the heathen round about in the valley of Jehosaphat,</hi> which is the valley of great slaughter. And because of this great desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Lord makes in all the Earth, many have fled to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the wrath of the Lamb, yea to escape if it were possible
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34799:18"/> those plagues that have compassed them about; And many have desired rather to dye then to live, because of their great plagues, have sought after death rather then life; for in the day of the Lambs wrath who is able to stand? Yet in <hi>Mount-Sion,</hi> and in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> there hath been deliverance in the middest of all those judgements; for the foure winds must not blow upon the Earth, till the Angel came out of the East with the seale of the living God, and the servants of God were sealed in their fore-heads: And of every Tribe of the Children of Israel were sealed a certain number according to the foreknowledge of God: And also a great multitude which no man could number of all Nations, and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and People, and Tongues stood before the Lamb cloathed with white Robes, and Palmes in their hands, and cryed with a loud voyce, saying, <hi>Salvation to our God which sitteh upon the Throne, and to the Lamb: And all the Angels stood round about the Throne, and about the Elders, and the foure Beasts, and fell before the Throne on their faces, and worshipped God, saying, Amen. Blessing, and glory, and wisdome, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might be unto our God for ever and ever, Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Lord to make known his love to his people, declared to <hi>John,</hi> that in the time of great Tribulation many were saved, even all they that were sealed, whose names were written in the Lambs book of Life from the foundation of the World. I say, to reveale this mystery to <hi>John,</hi> that he might also make it known to the Churches; One of the Elders answered and said unto him, what are these that are arrayed in whi e Robes? and whence came they? And he said unto him, Sir, thou knowest: And he said unto <hi>John, These are they which came out of great Tribulation, and have washed their Robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, therefore are they before the Throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: And he that sitteth on the Throne shall dwell among them, they shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the Sunne light on them, nor any heate; For the Lamb which is in the middest of the Throne shall feed them, and shall lead them to living fountaines of waters, and God shall wipe away all teares from their eyes.</hi> Thus was declared to <hi>John</hi> the mystery of them that are saved through much Tribulation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the power of Darknesse in all the world. These are they who live and reigne with Christ a thousand yeares, Sathan being bound and chained for deceiving them; but the rest of the dead, which are many in the Nations, lived not: and this is the first Resurrection. <hi>Blessed and holy are they that have part in the first Resurrection, for such shall not be hurt of the second death.</hi> These are they who are faithfull unto Death, and so obtain a Crowne of Life, being freed from the second Death by the blood of the Lamb. These are they, who according to their measure of faith, and ability of knowledg walke in righteousnesse, bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit, suffering persecution and reproaches patiently for righteousnesse sake.</p>
                  <p>But this I am perswaded, that Satan is let loose out of his prison, and running swiftly in the Nations, to gather together great multitudes, even

And this also understand, that since I was converted to the knowledge of the Truth, I have not learned of any man, neither have I much regarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans Doctrine, (but the Doctrine of the holy Apostles, of the Lamb, and all the holy Scriptures which I find profitable unto Salvation, through Faith which is in Christ) not that I thought my self more wise then others, (the Lord is my Witness who knoweth all hearts) but I saw my self in great darkness, and much confusion amongst all; wherefore I understand us all to be in the Wilderness, and sore oppressed with the yoke of <hi>Babel,</hi> so that all is full of division, confusion, and great desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which my prayer is may cease in <hi>Sion,</hi> and that the Daughter of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> may be made strong, having her horns of iron, and hoofs of brass, that she may beat in pieces many people. And this I exhort you my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to pray for the peace of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for they shall prosper that love it, let him have no rest, till the holy City, which is trodden under foot, be built again, <hi>then shall Babylon fall, that great City that raigns over all the earth, and be no more a City, but a desolate place, for great is the Lord that will judge her; then will there be joy in</hi> Sion, <hi>and great gladness in</hi> Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>for then shall be blessed the Inheritance of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any one desire to know what manner of person I am, thus far I do acquaint them, that I am not wise and learned, according to the flesh, neither rich nor honourable, but am one that desires to be wise in this, <hi>to know the living and true God, and his Son Jesus Christ, which is life eternal.</hi> And my Brethren who are not wise and learned, I exhort you to get wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and learning; this understand, <hi>that the fear of the Lord is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of wisdome, and a good understanding have they that keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:34799:20"/> This is true wisdome, to fear the Lord, and this I would have thee to know, by Faith, Iesus Christ, believe that he died for thy sins, and that thou hast all thy sins pardoned by his Death, and hope also that thou shalt live for ever; for this is the promise of the Father to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Son, therefore this is good tidings to thee: First, that all thy sins are pardoned and freely forgiven thee, and then when thou depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est this life, enter into heaven, and there live for ever in glory unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ, and with all his holy Angels. Now if thou believe in Jesus Christ for remission of sins, and hope in God (that made heaven and earth, and all things therein) for eternal life, who is well able to give it thee, thou shalt be saved; but this thou must also do, walk in his Commandments, and the chief Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Love, <hi>Love all men, do to all men as thou would they should do unto thee, this is the Law and the Prophets:</hi> This is easie and plain doctrine to be understood.</p>
                  <p>And if thou desire to do the Commandments, keep with thee this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>to do unto all men, as thou would they should do unto thee;</hi> and if thou can believe in Jesus Christ, and hope in God, and endeavour to have a good conscience void of offence, both towards God and man, doing all things as in the presence of God, thou needs not doubt in the least the salvation of thy soul, because he hath promised that cannot lie. Now this is excellent wisdome, to believe the Gospel, and pure learning to yeeld obedience to the same, for this is better then fleshy wisdome, and far more excellent then carnal learning, <hi>For he hath confounded the wisdome of the wise, and brought to nought the und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Now if any who is wise according to the flesh, and desires to be wise and learned according to the Spirit, let such a one become a fool, that he may be wise in denying himself, his own wisdome and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and live in obedience to his Commandments, praying servently to the Lord for the things he stands in need of, and henceforth consult no more with flesh and blood, but with all meekness receive by Faith the living Word, which is able to save his soul; this is my counsel to thee that art wise and learned, if thou desire to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the Truth of the Gospel of Life, and to know the holy Scriptures, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto salvation, <hi>even able to make wise unto Salvation, through Faith which is in Christ;</hi> Seek not by reading many books, seek not by thy own wisdome, study, and industry, as thousands have done and faln short, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor Phylosophers Fables, and books of curious Arts, if thou have them, burn them: as the holy Brethren did in the Apostles time, when they came to the knowledge of the Truth, for Phylosophy is very unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this I say, seek the Lord by faith, repentance, and new obedience, turn from all thy sins, and bring forth fruit meet unto repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve stedfastly in Jesus Christ for remission of all thy sins, hope in God for the promise which he hath made to them that believe, which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. Now if thou thus believe the Gospel with obedience, thou art blessed indeed, and art come to principles of excellent wisdome, thou art come to be a child of God, an heir of eternal glory, thou art come to believe in him who made heaven and earth, the Sea, and all things in them, who is the All-sufficient and Almighty God, with whom nothing is impossible, who hath light dwelling in the immortality, which no mortal man can approach unto; he searches the heart, and trieth the reins, and knows every secret thing, all things are open and naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, now walk as in the presence of such a God, endeavouring at all times to do his will, in yeelding obedience to his Commandments: Instead of reading books of Controversie, and unprofitable disputations of men of corrupt minds, read the holy Scriptures, in which thou may find both much comfort and profit, if thou believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ. And when thou readest mysteries which thou understands not, be not thou troubled, but wait patiently upon the Lord, and pray to him, even the God of heaven, who is the Revealer of all secrets, and be thou sure to keep in the Faith of the Son of God, and hope of Eternal Life, having love towards God and man; be careful to have thy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation excellent in all manner of holiness, for it is written, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi> And in this also shall it be known that thou art a child of God, if thou delight in righteousness and holiness. This understand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that the holy Scriptures came not by the will and wisdome of man, but the holy men of God spoke them forth as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, therefore no man understands them, but they to whom they are revealed, and made known by the same spirit that spoke them forth; Therefore seek not to know them by thy own wisdome, or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish learning, but pray thou unto the Lord to give thee of his Spirit, that thou may discern the things that are spiritual, <hi>For the natural man knowe not the things of God, neither indeed can he, because all they are spiritually discerned: But the spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of God. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is every one that receiveth the spirit of God as an earnest of the inheritance, by which they are sealed up unto the day of redemption.</hi> And thus have I given my advice (both to the wise and unwise, learned and unlearned) who

                  <p>Now concerning false Prophets and Seducers, there are many in the world who outwardly have on sheeps cloathing, but inwardly are raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wolves, even as the Lord Jesus Christ hath said should come. And also have not many false Christs come in his Name saying, they have been Christ: And many have said, <hi>Loe here, and loe there is Christ,</hi> and many have been deceived. If it please not the Lord to shorten these dayes, I feare few will be saved (but <hi>the Lord knows his owne, and none of them shall perish</hi>) For now is a time of great desolation, I desire not to be found bringing railing Accusations against any; for this I understand, that the Scriptures must be fulfilled: For false Prophets and Deceivers are Ministers of the wrath of God, and do receive in themselves the recompence of all their errour: For this understand, that if any Prophet be deceived, the Lord hath deceived that Prophet, by putting a lying spirit in his mouth <note place="margin">Ezek. 14.9. 1 King. 22,23.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this my great desire, that the Lord would hasten to rebuke Satan &amp; all his Ministers, who beare his image in all manner of unrighteousnesse, for the markes of false Prophets are all manner of ungodlinesse, their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is from below, <hi>earthly, sensuall, and devillish.</hi> They follow covetous practices, in looking for their gaine for their Quarters; They love to feed themselves with the fat, and cloath themselves with the Fleece: <hi>They cry peace, peace to them that put into their mouths, but such as refuse, they prepare warre against.</hi> They say, <hi>Come bring wine, let us fill our selves with strong drinke, for to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant:</hi> They are such as serve their owne bellies, and not the Lord Jesus Christ, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more for filthy lucre and ungodly gaine, then the good of Christs Flock. They are like silly women, <hi>ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, having eyes full of adultery that cannot cease to sinne.</hi> Now if any one that reads these things finde himselfe guilty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned in his owne heart, let him also know that God is greater then his heart, and knoweth all things. It is not I that judge him, yet let him know that he shall come to judgement, and receive according to his workes, whether good or evill.</p>
                  <p>Now this is my counsell to thee, who believes thou art a Minister of Christ.</p>
                  <p>First, consider whether thou be acquainted with the truth of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel thy selfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, consider whether thou walke orderly according to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; for this understand, that such as teach the Gospell to others, should first know it themselves.</p>
                  <p>Now this is a thing worthy to be considered in these dayes, and also admired, how the Apostles, when they had received Commandement, went from Nation to Nation preaching the Gospel, and such as were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained unto life believed the Gospell, and were established in the Faith, and received immediately both what to believe, and how to walke, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34799:21"/> they might be saved. The Apostles preached not the Gospel with wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of words that mans wisdome, teaches, but in plainnesse of speech, and power of the spirit: They stayed not long in a place, but passed (as I may so say) swiftly in the Nations, yet made known the excellent wisdome of God to them that believed; and such as believed became a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to teach one another in the same Doctrine they had learned of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: Therefore thou that desirest to be a Minister of Christ, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus have I written largely according to my understanding, of the things that were, and of the things that are, and the things that I believe shall shortly come: But I would not that any should take me as wise, or as a Prophet, but rather as a child in the knowledge of heavenly my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and as a Brother labouring for the Kingdome of God, and looking for the coming of Jesus Christ in the clouds of heaven, according to his word: Though I have spoken Prophesie, let no man despise me, but this understand, that the Lord hath not spoken to me by words in vision, as he did to his holy Prophets, neither hath he powred forth the Holy Ghost upon me, as upon the holy Apostles of the Lamb, and many in those daies, (therefore let no one think of me above what I am or seem to be) but this he hath done to me, praised be his Name, he hath given me the same Spirit of Faith with them (as it is written) <hi>I have believed, and therefore do I speak.</hi> And this I say my Brethren (who am but a child, for I am with you, and the Lord also with us, though we know him not, yet are we known of him, for his promise was to be with his people to the end of the world) to the Law, and to the Testimony: And if I, or any other, speak not according to it, it is because there is no light i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Again, He that comes unto you, and not with this Doctrine of Salvation, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God-speed, lest you be partakers of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Therefore my Brethren I exhort you to search the Scriptures, whether those things I have written be so or not, for if they be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scripture, they are true, and if not, I have erred for want of knowledge. I am far from accounting my self infallible, but rather a lyar, in comparison of the Truth as it is in Jesus Christ: And marvel not if I count my self a liar, when <hi>Paul</hi> that great and faithful Apostle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted himself a liar, in comparison of the Truth of God, when he said, <hi>If the Truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory, why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</hi> The Apostles were not Gods, as some Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did imagine, but men subject to the like passions and infirmities that we are; and though they preached an infallible Gospel, yet were they not infallible, but had that Treasure in earthen vessels; but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is infallible still, though the knowledge thereof be small.</p>

For this I say, if a wicked man turn from his wickedness, and believe the Gospel with obedience, he shall be saved, for his sins shall not be imputed to him in the day of his deliverance. And also if a righteous man turn from his righteousness, and make shipwrack of Faith and a good conscience, he shall die in his iniquity, and his righteousness shall not be remembred in the day of his Transfiguration; therefore I say to the wicked, Repent, for great is the reward of the righteous, and to the righteous stand fast, for fearful is the end of the ungodly.

And thus is the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34799:24"/> knowledge of the way of Life given forth in the world, nevertheless the Lord knoweth his from the beginning, and none of them shall perish, for the gifts and callings of God are without repentance: Therefore my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Brethren, as many as believe in Jesus Christ with obedience, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count your selves Elect of God, and by encrease of love towards God and man, make your Election sure, for the promises of God are yea and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to all that endure to the end.

For now Brethren wee who are Elect, are the children of God; but yet it doth not appear what we shall be; but this I believe when he doth appear, we shall see him as he is, and be like him in glory, and be Kings and Priests, and reign upon the earth; then shall be fulfilled the word of the Lord, <note place="margin">Rev. 5.10.

And by the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

I speak not these things because of any trouble that I have in the Flesh, for I have peace both within and without, peace of conscience, and peace in the world. I praise the God of heaven and earth who is my Teacher, and hath made known to me the great mystery of eternall life. No earthly man hath taught me the things that I have learned, neither am I under any mans Ministery; yet do I not account my selfe sufficient, or worthy to be a Minister of the Gospel, but pray the Lord to send worthy Labourers into his harvest; for great is the Harvest, and few are the Labourers. And thus I make bold to do, to write concerning the way of Truth, as I have learned, that I also may be fruitfull, according to the measure of the gift of God in me: For it is lawfull for me (who am but base and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and the least of all Saints) so to do, if I goe not behinde the gift of God: And if I have therein exceeded, let the spirituall judge; but the Lord is my record whom I feare, that out of godly sincerity I have written these things according to the measure of my faith: And my great desire is now to grow in faith, and be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, that I may be counted worthy to enjoy the hope that is laid up in Heaven for all the Elect: For such is the reward of them that feare the Lord, that no affliction here can be worthy the glory that shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hereafter. Christ knew of this glory, which made him to embrace the Crosse, and despise the shame for the glory which was set before him, which was much to be desired; Therefore saith he after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, (speaking of his departure into his glory) I have a Baptisme to be baptized with, and how am I streightned till it be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>Again, he prayed the Father to glorifie him with the same glory he had with him before the world began; therefore having such strong consolation, I fear not but the reward is great and unspeakable glorious: And as for persecution I have no cause to fear, for I understand the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage spoken of, to stand in this Nation on its feet, <note place="margin">Dan. 2.33.</note> which are part iron, and part clay, partly strong, and partly weak, which mystery I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand doth signifie the many divisions; and though the Beast that killed the Saints (and persecuted the holy people) have his strength, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34799:27"/> his Kingdome is divided, he is become weak, for the great City is divided into three parts, therefore he wants his former power. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand also, that the Stone cut without hands, is ready to smite the feet; then let all that have the testimony of Jesus Christ, read what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the glorious Image, the Iron, the Clay, the Brass, the Silver, and the Gold.</p>
                  <p>Verily I cannot but Prophesie, that the coming of the Lord is nigh, even at the doors; not that I have any new Revelation, but the same which is written in the holy Scriptures by the Prophets and Apostles, and made known to me through the mystery of Faith; therefore do I write to make known the same to others, that if it be possible I may stir them up to wait for the same things. And though it were so, that the day of the Lord were not now at hand, I know it is profitable for us all to be zealous in the Lord, and walk as children of Light; for without all controversie, great is the mystery of godliness; which is to say, God manifest in the flesh, seen of Angels, preached in the world, believed by many, both <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> received up into glory, and the heavens must contain him till the restoration of all things, spoken of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; for the same Jesus, which all the Scriptures give witness to, shall surely come, and so come in like manner as he was seen go into heaven; for as a Cloud received him out of their sight, so shall he come in the Clouds of heaven with power and great glory, and every eye shall see him, even they that pierced him thorow. But this understand, that his second coming shall not be like his first, when he came in the form of a servant in the flesh, veil'd in the earthly Tabernacle, and laid down his life for the world; but his second coming will be in the glory of the Father, as a King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and we shall see him as he is in his own Kingdome, and heavenly Tabernacle, and he will reign, and we with him for evermore, and all his enemies shall utterly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, then shall that old Serpent, which is called the devil, and the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Beast, and the false Prophet, and <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and all the great multitude of the ungodly go into perdition and the smoke of their torment shall ascend up for ever, but the glory of the Lord will be marvellous in the Land of the Living: For as the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cometh out of the East, and shineth to the West, so shall the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Son of man be, <hi>for the world shall be full of his glory,</hi> and when he comes, the Saints he will bring with him in his Kingdome, and they shall appear with him in his glory, which he plainly shewed in his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration; for before he had said, <hi>That there was some standing there that should not taste of death, till they had seen the Kingdome of God come with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi> Then six daies after he took with him <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and was transfigured before them, his face did shine as the Sun, and his Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment became exceeding white, and there appeared with him in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in glory two Saints, which were <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias;</hi> without all doubt Christ will be unspeakable glorious in his Kingdome: For if the face of <hi>Moses</hi> did shine, who received the Ministration of death written, and in Tables of stone, so that the children of <hi>Israel</hi> could not behold, because of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34799:27"/> the glory of his countenance: How much rather shall not Christ be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous who hath the Ministration of Eternal Life, not written in Tables of stone, but in his own power, to give whom he will, for Christ is worthy of more glory then <hi>Moses,</hi> as much as the builder of the house is worthy more honour then the house; for <hi>Moses</hi> was faithful as a servant in the house of God, but the Son is the heir and builder of the house (which house we are that believe, and so far excelleth in glory; And this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand also, that the excellent Tabernacle of witness which the Lord commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to make, and shewed him the pattern, and bad him make all things according to the fashion thereof, which Tabernacle was a witness, and also a figure or shadow of the true and heavenly; and though it was excellent and beautiful to the eyes of men, I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it had little excellency in comparison of the heavenly, which the Saints do enjoy. And also the outward Temple was a most sumptuous building, very precious, rich and beautiful, which was a shadow of the Temple of Christs Body, which is his Church, and far more excellent, for the Saints are partakers with the Son of the same glory, therefore the true and heavenly do far exceed all earthly types and figures. And also the rich and excellent garments of <hi>Aaron,</hi> did signifie the unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beauty of Christ, who is a great High-priest over the house of God; so the excellency of the Tabernacle and Temple, and all things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto, were but figures and shadows of the heavenly, which shall appear at Christs coming in his Kingdome. And also King <hi>Davids</hi> victory over his enemies, doth signifie the victory of Jesus Christ over all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as he himself said, Bring those my enemies, that will not that I should reign over them, and stay them before me. Again, it shall come to pass, that they who will not have him to rule over them, shall be cut off from amongst his people, and he shall sit on the Throne of <hi>David</hi> for ever, therefore is he called <hi>David</hi> their King, and the wisdome and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the riches of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in those daies, was also a sign of the unspeakable wisdome and glory of Christ, and excellent riches and beauty of the new <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> made without hands, which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but shall come down according to his promise.</p>
                  <p>Now my beloved Brethren, seeing the Scriptures of Truth are so full of excellent Prophesies, which shall be fulfilled at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, let us all who are of his little Flock, watch to day, as though we knew he should come tomorrow, for who knows but the Sign of the Son of man hath appeared in the Clouds of heaven already.

                  <head>To the Brethren (in this Nation) elect according to the soreknowledge of God, grace from him, and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed towards you.</head>
                  <p>SInce I wrote the first Booke, I have now accomplished the worke I spoke of in it; For my desire was earnest to write concerning the Mysteries of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Trumpets, and seven last Plagues ministred by the seven holy Angells, and ministring Spirits of God; The which Mysteries I understand are declared by signification, being full of excellent wisdome, far above my understanding: Yet a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cording to the measure of faith and knowledge I have received, I have she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed their signification, answering with the other plain Scripture; for I understand there to be nothing spoken and declared in them, but excellently agreeing with the rest of the Scriptures, though it be hard to be understood: For this I perceive that they are spoken by signification, and the other more plain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, and they do sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fie the things that are written in the other. And the summe of my labour is, to shew what these great Mysteries do signifie according to plain Scripture: So I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e according to my measure of faith shewed their signification to agree with the other plain Scriptures, for the spirit of Truth in no wayes speaketh contrary things, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> cannot lye: So that if I have erred, the errour is from my selfe, and not from the Lord; But if I have declared the Truth, I may boldly say it is from the Lord, and I have not to glory save in him onely: For what I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that is good, is from the Lord, therefore I have no cause to boast as though I had not received, but to praise his Name who hath given unto me.</p>
                  <p>Now my beloved Brethren, all that believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, that come to read these things which I have written, I suppose you may plainly understand that I have not written after the manner of any that before hath written of these things: For many that have written of these things have poynted at certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son after the manner of men, and at certain times, and certain numbers, which is not lawfull for me to do, neither could I, for I am not so learned in Church History written since the Apostles. Yet this I am perswaded, that such as have know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>edge of the Times (by reading of Books) since the Apostles, may also under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that the things I have written are true: And that the Mysteries declared in the Revelations, do signifie all the things which have been fulfilled, and also do signifie the things that shall be fulfilled. And seeing they have signified the things that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re past, without all contradiction they do signifie the things that shall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d in their appointed time. Thus you may understand also, that I have not written so largely with many words of these things, as others have done before me, neither is my gift so to do; for this I understand, that the best wisdome stands not in the most words. And it is better to displease men in not using many words, then to displease the Lord in darkning wisdome through the multitude of words: And also this I understand, that the mystery of these great things have been hid and sealed up from the faithfull (in these times of darknesse) and were not to be revealed untill the latter end. Therefore my Brethren, it cannot be, but the end is at hand when the Vision shall speak, other wayes, I am perswaded such knowledge
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34799:29"/> would not have been given unto me: For <hi>I</hi> see not my self more righteous and holy then others, neither that I have deserved to know these things before others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am full of infirmities like unto others: And more that I see into the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Mysteries, the more I behold my own vilenesse. And were it not that I have boldnesse, by the blood of Jesus Christ, I might say, <hi>Woe is me, I am undone, because I am a man of polluted and unclean lips;</hi> but I have boldnesse by the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, because I look for Justification before God by him onely, and not in the least to be found in my owne righteousnesse, but in the righteousnesse of God, which is by the faith of Jesus Christ. Therefore let no one thinke of me more then I am, but rather admire the wisdome, power and goodnesse of God, which is ready to be revealed in the world. And prepare to be ready to stand before him at his coming, for certainly it is near at hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> this I would have thee to understand, that I have written in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> from the 7th verse in the 8. Chap. to the end of the Booke, and have written of every Mystery (according to my knowledge) that seems to be darke; but the words which are plain, it was necessary for me to say little of, but let them have their place. And for the other part of the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> from the first Chap. to the eighth Chap. and 7th. verse. I have written in the first Booke of the chiefe Things, and hardest Mysteries. Therefore my desire is, that such as read the one, would also consider the other; for in this Book I have spoken little of the plain Gospell, which is profitable to the ignorant, as <hi>I</hi> have largely done in the other, But have as the matter is agreeable, spoken of high mysteries which belong to the glorious Gospell: so that this Book is not so profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the ignorant as the other, though it answereth to the very same things. And thus I say, if I have spoken any thing in this book, or the other, contrary to the holy Scriptures, believe me not; for they that wrote the Scriptures were great Prophets and Apostles, who heard the words of God, and wrote as they were taught by the holy Ghost; but I am one that is very weake in Jesus Christ, and full of infirmities, and what I know is through the mystery of Faith, and am like unto the Saints now in the world, subject to many infirmities. Yet I thought it not meet to keep these things to my selfe, but rather to make them knowne. So desiring the blessing from God, farewell.</p>

                     <p>THis Mystery I understand doth signifie the Elect Childrens sharp fiery Trial, for so it pleased the Lord to purge <hi>Sion</hi> with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Judgement, and to chuse the children of the Kingdome in the Furnace of affliction, according as the Lord Jesus Christ said, Every man shall be salted with fire, &amp; every Sacrifice shall be salted with salt: And the Apostles taught the Brethren, that through much tribulation they must enter the Kingdome, the which tribulation <hi>Peter</hi> called the Fiery Trial; and this we may well understand, that many thousands since the coming forth of the Gospel, have suffered cruel death, and great persecution, for the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Lord Jesus Christ fore-seeing these times of great affliction, taught to his Church that whosoever would loose his life for his sake, and the Gospels, should find it; but whosoever would save his life for his sake, the same should loose it. Now all those whose names are written in the Lambs book of Life, from the foundation of the world, were faithful unto death, and so have obtained a Crown of Life; and these are on the Lambs side, being called, and chosen, and faithful, called according to the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34799:30"/> purpose of the Father, chosen from the beginning of the world, faithful in all tribulation, even unto death, but they who are called, and not chosen, cannot stand in the hour of temptation, and time of tribulation, but do fall away: And these are they Christ speaks of in the parable of the Sower, being like the unfruitful ground, and the seed that is sown thereon, brings not forth fruit: for some hearing the Word of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and not understanding it, are deceived by the wicked one, and so they have no profit by that which they have heard; and some hearing, but after are overcome with the world, the riches and pleasures thereof; for he that will be a lover of the world, must be an enemy unto God, for no man can serve God and Mammon, and it is a hard thing for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of heaven. Again, some when they hear the Word, with joy receive it, but when temptation and tribulation ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth for the words sake they fall away, but the children of the Kingdom are they, who hear the word, and with honest and good hearts do keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.

                     <p>The Star which was fallen from heaven, I understand to be the same before spoken of, but towards the latter end he should wax greater, and his Kingdome be inlarged; he received more power, having the Key of the Bottomless Pit given unto him: The mystery of the Bottomless Pit, I understand to be Phylosophy, devillish and earthly wisdome, and the mystery of the Key was his power to bring in such heathenish wisdome and learning, by which many were deceived; For when he had opened the bottomless pit, the smoak arose as the smoak of a great Furnace, by which the Sun and the Ayr were darkned, which doth signifie, when the mystery of iniquity begun to work, and the false Prophet had brought up Phylosophy and heathenish wisdome into the Church, the pure light and doctrine of the Gospel was darkned, by reason of the earthly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which began to be set up, for the exalting of the Man of Sin, that so, as it was written, he might be exalted above all that is called God.</p>
                     <p>And there came out of the smoak locusts upon the earth, which were the false Prophets; and in that they came out of the smoak of the pit, doth signifie, that they were learned in Phylosophy, heathenish wisdome, and learning; and to them was given power, as the Scorpions of the earth have power, which doth signifie their great power to hurt men, and in that they were commanded not to hurt the grass of the earth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any green thing, doth signifie, that they were not natural locusts, which hurt the fruits of the earth, but spiritually so called, and were to hurt only those men who have not the Seal of God in their foreh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And the shape of the Locusts was like unto horses prepared to battel; which doth signifie their mighty strength and valour, to devoure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy: And on their heads were Crowns like gold, doth signifie their
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34799:31"/> fleshly glory and honour in the world; for they being of the world, the world hears them, and speaks well of them. And their faces were as the faces of men, doth signifie their sheeps cloathing, and outward shew of holiness, having mens persons in admiration, because of advantage; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof. And they had hair as the hair of women, which doth signifie their foolishness, being deceived with the Serpent, as was <hi>Eve;</hi> they are silly women, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. And their teeth were as the teeth of Lions, doth signifie, that they had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on sheeps cloathing, but inwardly they were ravening Wolves; as it was written of them, They cry peace, peace, to them that put into their mouths; but such as refuse, they prepare war against. And they had breast-plates, as it were breast-plates of iron, which doth signifie their strong preparation, for their corrupt disputations and vain jangling, which only hath tended to sedition, to the subverting of many. And the sound of their wings were as the sound of many Chariots running to battel, doth signifie, their outward power to hold them up, for the great men, and the rich and honourable men of the earth, are on their side, and are as wings to bear them up, and so are their wings of great power, and their sound as the sound of many Chariots running to battel. And they had tails like unto Scorpions, which doth signifie their damnable doctrine, (as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, their word doth eat as doth a canker.) And their power was to hurt men five moneths, which I understand to be their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time. And they had a King over them, which is the Angel of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless pit. He is also the God of the world, and Prince of darkness, that worketh in the children of disobedience, whose name in the Hebrew Tongue is <hi>Abaddon,</hi> but in the Greek Tongue hath his name <hi>Apollyon;</hi> for he is a roaring Lion, goes about seeking whom he may devoure. Thus is the mystery of one wo declared, but more follow, because the end draws neerer.</p>

And thus do I understand the mystery of the seven Seals, in that they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Seals, and the number of the seven Angels, and the mysterie of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34799:54"/> the 7 Trumpets, and 7 golden Vials, which I have not before declared. Now some may say that my expositions are very dark, and short, and therefore unprofitable: to which I say, what I have writen is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the gift and measure of knowledge I have received, &amp; if my gift were to expound more plain, I should gladly do it: but this I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the great and high mysteries declared and signified in the Revelations cannot be expounded according to truth so plain, that they may be understood by any, but such as do rightlie understand the Doctrine of the Gospel written by the holy Apostles: for before any can come to know these mysteries, they must be well acquainted with the pure and uncorruptable Doctrine of the Gospel. For this I can truly say, that it pleased the Lord to make known to me the pure Gospel and Doctrine of life, and mightily to enlighten my dark understanding, in the writings of the holie Prophets and Apostles, but especially in the writings of the holy Apostles, (which are unspeakable profitable) in so much as I understood much of the Apostles, that the Apostles write to the Brethren, according to my desire, as though I had written them my self; (let no one mistake me, I speak not thus to compare my self with the holy Apostles, but only for edification) yea, I understood them after so plain a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which before I never expected, for which I have cause to praise the God of Heaven, the Revealer of the secrets, (And other things than these I should speak of, but for the present I shall forbare, least any one should think of me more than I am, or at the least seem to be,) And though such knowledge of the Gospel and pure Doctrine of the holy Apostles was revealed to me, when I was minded to write of the great Mysteries in the Revelations, I found my s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Now this I would have you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that though I was deceived in understanding the mysterie of the seventh Trumpet (for I thought it had been in fulfilling with the other) yet I was spiritually in the same mind that I am now, concerning the end of the World, and Christs coming to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though then I understood it not in such distinct order: for now I understand, that the seventh Trumpet shall not sound till
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34799:55"/> the very end of time; for in the dayes when the seventh Angel shall begin to sound, the mystery of God shall be fulfilled, as he hath declared to his Servants the Prophets: wherefore I understand, that the mystery of the seventh Trumpet shall be great, but quickly fulfilled; for I understand, that the mystery of Iniquity shall be fulfilled in all the earth, in the dayes of the six Trumpets sounding; in which time the Beast shall have fulfilled his number, which once was counted 666, but I am perswaded now the time is very nigh, that his number may be written thus 000<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">

And this <hi>I</hi> say, without the knowledge of the Gospel you cannot be saved, but this <hi>I</hi> believe, that many thousands of thousands have been saved who have not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the mysteries of the Revelations; therefore I account the knowledge of the Gospel more excellent than the knowledge of these Mysteries, for without the knowledge of the Gospel we cannot be saved, but without the knowledge of these Mysteries we may: and this know also, that you must first learn the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Gospel, before you can come to the knowledge of these Mysteries; for it is expedient every way to get into the Faith of Jesus Christ, and hope of eternal life, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes you can never attain to the knowledge of the Scriptures, neither the salvation of your Souls.</p>

                     <p>Brethren, this I think good to acquaint you, that I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in my writings said, as the Apostle saith, or as Christ saith, when it may be that I have not written the very same word; that Christ said, or that the Apostle or Apostles said, which it may be some will dislike, or be offended at; but this I say, to satisfie in this thing, that, according to my memory, I have written the same words, and sometimes I write the very same words as I find them in Scripture; but often, according to my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I did remember them, which I knew to be either as it was written, or according to it. And this I knew when I wrote the words that Christ spoke, or the Apostles spoke, I write the Truth: and also when I wrote words to the same purpose, I kept in the Truth; for when I say, as the Apostle saith, though <hi>I</hi> write not the very same words which he saith, but words agreeing thereto; I go not a stray from the Truth: such liberty I have in the Spirit, for I do not only mean, as the Apostle saith, but according to what he saith, or agreeing to that which he saith, though willingly I go not astray from Christs words, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles words, because I value them far more than mine own; for their words I choose as only directions to eternal life, by the power and goodness of God, and so do esteem their words to be the words of eternal life.</p>
                     <p>Now ye beloved of the Lord (however ye are called) all that have any Faith in Jesus Christ, and hope in the promise of God, which is eternal life to all that believe in his Son. I acquaint you with a great and excellent Mysterie, such a Mystery as I believe no other hath done before me, which is unspeakable ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to all that fear God, but a fearfull and terrible thing to the wicked and unbelieving generation: but I speak to the Wise, therefore judge what I say. Behold the sign of the Son of Man hath appeared in the clouds of Heaven already, of which I am an Eye-witness, which makes me write so boldly of his spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy coming to judgement, with power and great glory according to the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Therfore may I not say, arise, arise ye wise Virgins, and trim your Lamps, for the Bridegroom is ready to come, O Daughters of Jerusalem make hast, how long will you stay in your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Chamber of Mourning? O Daughters of Sion, put off your vile apparel, and mourning Garments, your beloved is nigh at hand, and hath prepared for you of old rich glistering Vestures, shining more than the Sun, yea precious Ornaments, and Jewels of unspeakable worth: Kings shall stand in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and Princes shall be filled with your Love, the Queens shall admire you greatly, and the elect Ladies shall rejoyce in your beauty, and wonder at your rich attire, yea all that are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

Therefore to all you that mourn in <hi>Sion</hi> I say, lift up your heads for your redemption is verie nigh, and your everlasting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance meet at hand.</p>
